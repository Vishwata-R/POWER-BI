 **Credit Card and Customer Analysis**


# Credit Card and Customer Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of credit card  and customer data, providing valuable insights into revenue trends, customer behaviour, and risk management. The analysis is based on a dataset of customer demographics, financial behaviour, and credit card usage. The visualizations and analysis were created using Power BI.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide actionable insights that can be used to optimize credit card offerings, strengthen risk management strategies, and improve customer engagement. By analysing customer data, we can identify key trends and patterns that can inform business decisions and drive growth.

## Key Insights

The analysis reveals several key insights across two main areas: Credit Card Analysis and Customer Analysis.

### Credit Card Analysis Insights

* **Revenue and Profit Trends:** Significant variations in revenue and profit were observed across different credit card categories. This highlights opportunities to optimize offerings and marketing strategies for maximum profitability.
* **Credit Utilization & Risk:** Analysis of credit utilization ratios revealed potential financial strain among some customers. Monitoring delinquent accounts and those exceeding credit limits is crucial for effective risk management. The dashboard now includes a targeted list of these accounts for immediate action.
* **Customer Activation:** While a large portion of customers activate their cards promptly, delayed activations suggest potential gaps in onboarding and engagement processes. The customer activation rate within 30 days continues to be a key area for improvement.
* **Spending Behaviour:** Monthly expenditure trends exhibit seasonal patterns, providing valuable information for targeted promotions and financial planning. Monthly spending patterns across key expense categories are tracked to identify trends and seasonality.
* **Credit Limit Distribution:** The distribution of credit limits reflects a segmentation strategy based on financial stability and risk assessment. This data is crucial for credit risk assessment and management, allowing for informed decisions regarding credit limit assignments.
* **Revenue from Fees & Interest:** Both interest earnings and annual fees contribute to overall profitability. However, a heavy reliance on interest revenue may indicate increased financial risk. Revenue from interest and annual fees is consistently monitored across different card types.
* **Weekly Profit Variations:** Fluctuations in weekly profit highlight specific periods of high revenue, enabling more effective financial strategy and campaign planning. Weekly profit trends are monitored to identify fluctuations and potential areas for improvement.

### Customer Analysis Insights

* **Demographics:** Understanding the distribution of customers across age groups and genders allows for targeted marketing and product development. The customer base is comprised of [41.83%] female and [58.17%] male customers, providing a clear picture of gender distribution. Customers are segmented into various age groups to understand their specific financial needs and preferences.
* **Financial Segmentation:** Analysing income levels by job type facilitates the development of tailored financial products and credit allocation strategies. Average income levels vary significantly across different job categories, providing insights into the financial capacity of our customer segments. The overall income distribution of our customer base is visualized to understand the range and concentration of income levels.
* **Loan Distribution:** The prevalence of personal loans among customers presents cross-selling opportunities and also provides insights into potential financial strain. A significant portion ([12.72%]) of our customer base has active personal loans, indicating potential financial needs and opportunities for cross-selling.
* **Education & Marital Status Trends:** Patterns in education and marital status reveal how different demographic groups interact with financial products, enabling personalized marketing efforts. Visualized the relationship between marital status and education level, revealing insights into the demographic profile of our customers.
* **Geographical Income Distribution:** Identifying high-income customer clusters by region supports strategic business expansion. Geographic distribution of average income is visualized to identify high-potential markets and regional variations in financial capacity.
* **Customer Satisfaction:** Analysing satisfaction scores across age groups helps pinpoint areas for service improvement and enhanced customer retention. Customer satisfaction scores are analysed across different age groups to identify areas for improvement in customer experience.
* **Household & Financial Responsibilities:** Understanding the financial needs of customers with dependents informs loan and credit product design. The number of dependents varies across different job categories, providing insights into the financial responsibilities of our customers.
* **Income Distribution Patterns:** Income segmentation allows for categorizing customers based on financial stability and spending potential.
